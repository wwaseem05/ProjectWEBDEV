		<p><b>"Masque of The Read Death"</b></p>
		<p>In the midst of a rampant and infectious epidemic known as the Red Death, Prince Prospero, an insensitive and imaginative individual, along with his companions, organizes an extravagant masquerade ball. Despite the imminent danger and their privileged status, they appear oblivious to the risks involved. However, their illusion of safety is shattered when the Red Death itself makes an appearance. In contemporary times, some individuals revisit this tale, while others find it uncomfortably relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

		<p><b>"The Tell Tale Heart"</b></p>
		<p>This story, being one of Poe's shortest, embodies many essential aspects of his writing. It effectively portrays recurring themes of guilt, paranoia, murder, and unnamed narrators justifying their deeds. The chilling image of the victim's heart pulsating beneath the floorboards is a prime example of Poe's ability to blur the boundaries between psychological and supernatural horror, making it an iconic and eerie depiction.<p>

			<p><b>"The Pit and The Pendulum"</b></p>
			<p>With an uncanny ability to immerse both the narrator and readers in an atmosphere of suspense and impending danger, this story manages to evoke a sense of immediate peril. Set during the Inquisition in Europe, the unnamed narrator finds themselves confined within a cell, caught between two treacherous forms of torture: a deep pit and a pendulum blade swinging ominously overhead, resembling a sharp scythe. The nightmarish imagery employed in the narrative breathes life into age-old clich√©s, transforming the notion of being trapped in a crucible or caught between a rock and a hard place into a terrifying reality, both in a literal and metaphorical sense.
