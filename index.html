				  <h4><i>A Little bit About Edgar...</i></h4>
				  <p> Edgar Allen Poe was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States, and of American literature. He was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction.</p>
				  <p>Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. </p>

				<p>Poe's unique writing style, psychological depth, and exploration of dark themes have made him an enduring figure in literature. His haunting and atmospheric storytelling, as well as his ability to delve into the human psyche is what inspired me to make this website.</p>
				<p>Don't worry - there are no spoliers. I hope you enjoy my favourite picks from my favourite author of all time!</p>
